Home Loan Interest Policy:
Home loan interest rates may be fixed or floating. Fixed rates remain constant during the tenure, while floating rates change based on market benchmarks and RBI guidelines.

Personal Loan EMI Calculation:
EMI is calculated using the formula: EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N − 1], where P is principal, R is monthly interest rate, and N is tenure in months.

Foreclosure Charges:
Foreclosure charges may apply if a loan is closed before the agreed tenure. Charges vary depending on loan type and policy guidelines.

Late Payment Penalty:
If EMI is not paid on time, a late payment penalty may be applied as per the loan agreement terms.

Account Update Policy:
Customer details such as address, mobile number, or email can be updated through official portal verification or branch visit with valid identification.

Loan Processing Time:
Loan processing typically takes 3 to 7 working days depending on documentation verification and eligibility assessment.
